# Morse Code Game
This is a game that uses morse code. There are a total of 4 rounds. In each round, the player is communicated a random color in morse code. 
The player must translate the morse code message and click the correct color button. If they make a mistake in any round, the game ends. 
If they make it to the end of round 4, a blue light flashes three times and they must enter the entire color sequence. If they enter it correctly, they win. 

The game was created using C and an STM32 Nucleo Board.
